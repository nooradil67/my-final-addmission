Minimum Marks: Most universities require at least 50â€“60% marks in intermediate.

Merit Criteria: Admission is usually based on intermediate marks + university entry test (if applicable).

2. Program-wise Eligibility Based on Intermediate Stream

A) ICS (Intermediate in Computer Science)
Eligible for: BS Computer Science (BSCS), BS IT, BS Data Science, BS AI, BS Software Engineering
Must have studied Mathematics + Computer Science/Physics/Statistics.
Minimum 50% marks. If Math was not studied, deficiency course (6 credit hours) required.

B) FSc Pre-Engineering
Eligible for: BS Engineering (Electrical, Mechanical, Civil, etc.), BSCS, BS IT, BS Data Science
Must have Math, Physics, Chemistry. Minimum 60% marks. ECAT test required for engineering.

C) FSc Pre-Medical
Eligible for: BS Biotechnology, BS Zoology, BS Botany, BS Biochemistry, BS Nutrition, BS Nursing
Must have Biology. Minimum 50â€“60% marks. BSCS/IT possible only with additional Math or deficiency course.

D) ICom (Intermediate in Commerce)
Eligible for: BBA, BS Accounting & Finance, BS Commerce, BS Economics, BS Banking & Finance
Typically 60% marks. Not eligible for Engineering or BSCS without Math.

E) FA (Intermediate in Arts/Humanities)
Eligible for: BS English, BS Mass Communication, BS IR, BS Psychology, BS Education, BS Sociology, etc.
Entry test or portfolio may be required. Not eligible for technical programs.

F) DAE (Diploma of Associate Engineering)

Some universities allow BS Engineering admission with additional conditions.

3. Deficiency Courses and Special Cases
Students without Math for BSCS/IT must study a 6-credit Math deficiency course during first year.
Foreign or diploma holders must apply for HEC equivalence via eservices.hec.gov.pk.
Some universities allow switching fields with bridging/deficiency courses.
